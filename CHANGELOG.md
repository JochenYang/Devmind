## [1.14.1] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- **üêõ Critical Bug Fixes**: Memory graph generation issues resolved
  - Fixed HTML/JSON files generated to wrong directory (IDE install dir ‚Üí project directory)
    - Issue: Files were saved to MCP server's `process.cwd()` (IDE installation path)
    - Solution: Added `getProjectPath()` to retrieve correct project path from database
  - Fixed node hover tooltip showing only truncated label
    - Issue: Tooltip only displayed first 40 characters of content
    - Solution: Now shows full content preview (500 characters) + metadata (type, importance, created time, file path)
  - Fixed default node limit preventing full memory visualization
    - Issue: Default `max_nodes=30` only showed 30 most important contexts
    - Solution: Changed default to `max_nodes=0` (show all memories), users can optionally limit
  - Fixed template string escaping in HTML generation causing TypeScript compilation errors

### Changed
- **GraphNode Interface**: Extended with `content` field to store full context content
- **File Path Logic**: Now uses project database path as primary source, falls back to `process.cwd()` if unavailable
- **Default Behavior**: Memory graphs now show ALL contexts by default (not limited to 20-30)
- **Tooltip Enhancement**: Hover tooltips now include comprehensive metadata for better context understanding

### Technical Details
- Added `getProjectPath(projectName: string)` method to query database for project directory
- Modified `max_nodes` default from `30` to `0` (unlimited)
- Updated node tooltip generation to avoid template string nesting issues
- GraphNode interface now includes both `label` (truncated) and `content` (full) fields

### User Experience
- üè† Files now correctly saved to project `./docs/` directory
- üîç Hover tooltips provide much more context for decision-making
- üåê Knowledge graphs show complete project memory by default
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform path handling improved

## [1.14.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **üöÄ Multi-Dimensional Quality Scoring System**: Advanced context quality evaluation
  - 6-dimensional scoring: relevance, freshness, completeness, accuracy, usefulness, overall
  - Time decay algorithm: 7 days=1.0, 30 days=0.8, 90 days=0.5, 180 days=0.3
  - Usage frequency tracking: reference count and search count
  - Automatic search hit recording during `semantic_search`
  - New tool: `update_quality_scores` - Batch recalculate quality scores for contexts
  - Enhanced search ranking: 50% semantic similarity + 30% relevance + 15% freshness + 5% usefulness

- **üìä Memory Graph Visualization**: Export project memory relationships as interactive graphs
  - 3 export formats:
    - **Mermaid** (default): Instant rendering in Claude Desktop, zero file generation
    - **HTML**: Interactive D3.js visualization with drag, zoom, and search (saved to `./docs/`)
    - **JSON**: Raw graph data for custom analysis and import to other tools
  - Smart node filtering: limit max nodes, filter by context type (solution/error/code/etc.)
  - Node styling: different colors and shapes for different context types
  - Relationship visualization: depends_on, fixes, implements, tests, documents
  - New tool: `export_memory_graph` - Generate memory graph in Mermaid/HTML/JSON formats
  - Cross-platform compatible: Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and all MCP clients

### Changed
